      Pass 'true' to skip check for safe canary deployments.  Applies
      only to the isLocked command.

      The default strictly checks that there is exactly one active
      deployment version; production mode skips this to allow
      deploying a new version even if previous rollout is stuck, or if
      no version is deployed at all.
